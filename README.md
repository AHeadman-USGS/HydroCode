# HydroCode
Stream permanence project work
Code here is part of an ongoing project for updates to the NHD fCode values for the American West.
The goal is to identify quantitative factors which can either contribute to or identify stream permance in arid regions.
Stream name is also part of the equation as a qualative factor.  Currently it is not part of the LDA dataset, but it is
something I plan on adding in.
